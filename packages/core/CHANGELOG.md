# @ogygia/core

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- [#95](https://github.com/ogygiajs/ogygia/pull/95) [`aab90f7`](https://github.com/ogygiajs/ogygia/commit/aab90f7c2cf6bd15d17bdf9e293646cd9a8cc3ff) Thanks [@PuruVJ](https://github.com/PuruVJ)! - The "uses ogygia marks, but its package declares no ogygia.files" warning fires only for a real marked import, not for a dependency whose comments, strings or error messages merely mention `with { wake }` (the plugin packages tripped it).

## 0.11.0

### Patch Changes

- [#83](https://github.com/ogygiajs/ogygia/pull/83) [`b0a6cd3`](https://github.com/ogygiajs/ogygia/commit/b0a6cd336627a7e34fdef0141131c3905ecfbd38) Thanks [@PuruVJ](https://github.com/PuruVJ)! - Remote deferred holes now share local holes' lifetime and renewal: they were signed for a fixed 5 minutes and answered 410 after, so a stored or cached page older than that showed dead remote regions. Plugins sign with core's rule through `app.capability`.

## 0.0.0
