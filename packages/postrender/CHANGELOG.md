### Patch Changes

- [#130](https://github.com/ogygiajs/ogygia/pull/130) [`fede66a`](https://github.com/ogygiajs/ogygia/commit/fede66ae685497399a257cb2a498516364e8064b) Thanks [@PuruVJ](https://github.com/PuruVJ)! - The hook types type-check on SvelteKit 3 too: `Handle` is the library's own (Kit 3 moved Kit's to `@sveltejs/kit/hooks`), so a Kit 3 app no longer sees an untyped `handle` from ogygia, devtools or postrender.
- Updated dependencies [[`fede66a`](https://github.com/ogygiajs/ogygia/commit/fede66ae685497399a257cb2a498516364e8064b)]:

### Patch Changes

- [#83](https://github.com/ogygiajs/ogygia/pull/83) [`e229a9a`](https://github.com/ogygiajs/ogygia/commit/e229a9a326d2f7f8cd429ed8841c10d96763b57f) Thanks [@PuruVJ](https://github.com/PuruVJ)! - The deploy-thaw build marker no longer lapses after a day: it is stored apart from the page TTL and rewritten every boot.
